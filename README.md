# Vendor Performance Analysis

## Project Description
This project analyzes vendor sales performance using a dataset of liquor sales, purchases, and inventory metrics. It involves data loading from a SQLite database, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering (e.g., calculating gross profit, profit margins, stock turnover, order sizes, and unsold inventory value), and visualization through a Power BI dashboard. The goal is to provide insights into top-performing vendors, sales trends, profitability, and inventory efficiency.

The Jupyter notebook handles data processing and EDA, including connecting to SQLite for data retrieval, using libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and SciPy for analysis and statistical tests. Key features engineered include metrics like Profit Margin, Stock Turnover, Sales-to-Purchase Ratio, and categorization of order sizes.

The Power BI dashboard visualizes key metrics such as total sales, top vendors, sales by product, freight costs, and stock turnover, enabling interactive exploration of the data.

Technologies used: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy, SQLite3), SQL for querying, and Power BI for visualization.

The processed dataset is exported as a CSV for further use. Screenshots from the dashboard are included for reference.
